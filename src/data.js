For hope is a necessary ingredient for our hopes to become reality. Our dreams is only limited by how hard we can meme. The universe was made for you, if it wasn't, it is better to think that it was. To some extent (perhaps a greater extent than we can yet quite fathom), how we perceive and approach the world creates a world that appears to us in that form — as “real.”As Werner Heisenberg put it: “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” The future is going to be better than you can imagine, if it’s not it’s better to think that it is. Not just because it gives you better vibes in the moment, but because it actually increases the chance that it is better. Our limits are only defined by how high we meme.",
